Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between sleep patterns, health metrics, and the prevalence of sleep disorders across different occupations and age groups.

Objectives

Examine attributes such as:

• Sleep duration

• Sleep quality

• Physical activity level

• Stress level

• BMI category

• Blood pressure

• Heart rate

• Daily steps

• Presence of sleep disorders


✓ Use exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling to gain insights.

✓ Identify factors influencing sleep quality and overall health.

✓ Support interventions for promoting better sleep habits and well-being across demographics.


Key Attributes

1. Sleep Duration

Total hours of sleep obtained within a given period.

Helps assess sleep sufficiency and detect potential sleep deprivation.



2. Sleep Quality

Subjective measure of restfulness and rejuvenation.

Includes ease of falling asleep, depth of sleep, interruptions, and feeling upon waking.



3. Physical Activity Level

Amount of exercise or movement measured by duration and intensity.

Higher activity levels are often linked with better sleep and health.



4. Stress Level

Perceived psychological stress experienced by an individual.

Stress can impact both sleep patterns and overall well-being.


5. BMI Category

Body Mass Index classification (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

Can indicate risks of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.



6. Blood Pressure

Measurement of systolic and diastolic pressure.

Poor sleep or sleep disorders are often correlated with hypertension.



7. Heart Rate

Resting heart rate and variability during sleep.

Serves as an indicator of sleep stages and cardiovascular health.



8. Daily Steps

Number of steps taken per day as a measure of baseline activity.

Physical activity can positively influence sleep efficiency.



9. Presence of Sleep Disorders

Identifies conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or restless leg syndrome.

Essential for understanding how disorders affect overall sleep and health.
