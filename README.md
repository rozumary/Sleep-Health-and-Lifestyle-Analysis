Objectives

Examine attributes such as:

Sleep duration

Sleep quality

Physical activity level

Stress level

BMI category

Blood pressure

Heart rate

Daily steps

Presence of sleep disorders


Use exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling to gain insights.

Identify factors influencing sleep quality and overall health.

Support interventions for promoting better sleep habits and well-being across demographics.


Key Attributes

1. Sleep Duration

Total hours of sleep obtained within a given period.

Helps assess sleep sufficiency and detect potential sleep deprivation.



2. Sleep Quality

Subjective measure of restfulness and rejuvenation.

Includes ease of falling asleep, depth of sleep, interruptions, and feeling upon waking.



3. Physical Activity Level

Amount of exercise or movement measured by duration and intensity.

Higher activity levels are often linked with better sleep and health.
